Summary
--------

Model based successive approximation is an iterative method to find the exact inverse solution of a problem using a simplified model. In the paper: "Finding the exact solution using an inexact model; A recursive approach for inverse modelling", this method is presented, and utilized to approximate a topography, uncoupling distributed interaction forces.
